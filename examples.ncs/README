This is the NCS example collection. Most (all) examples here require
a working NCS installation and also a working ConfD installation.
ConfD 3.1 or later is required. The reason ConfD is needed is that we're
using ConfD to emulate managed devices.

All Makefiles below will check for $NCS_DIR and also $CONFD_DIR, thus
to run the examples the 'confdrc' and 'ncsrc' files in ConfD and NCS
must be sourced prior to running the examples.

Thus, we need to source the rc files:

# . /path/to/confd-<confd-vsn>/confdrc
# . /path/to/ncs-<ncs-vsn>/ncsrc

ConfD is used in these examples to emulate managed devices
that can speak NETCONF, speak Cisco CLI or speak SNMP northbound.
The order of sourcing is important, we must source confdrc before we source ncsrc

A working java installation is required with a properly
installed ant environment. Ant is used to build all
service logic applications. On Ubuntu, do:

# sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jdk ant

or

# sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk ant
